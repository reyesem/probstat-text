"0","#| fig-cap: The time-series plot for several samples of size 100 taken sequentially.  The first observation is taken from a Standard Normal distribution; each subsequent observation is taken from a Normal distribution centered on the previous observation with a variance of 1.  One sample is highlighted for illustration.  "
